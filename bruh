1. Determine the output.
int i = 0;
while (i < 5)
{
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
System.out.println(i);
012345



2. Consider the code shown below.
  a. Determine the output.
  b. What is the value of u after the code is executed?
  c. What is the value of i after the code is executed?

int u = 0;
while (u < 4)
{
    int i = u * u;
    u++;
    System.out.println(i);
}




3. Fix the code to make it print the integers from 0 to 4 inclusive:
int i = 0
while (i < 5)
{
    System.out.println(i);
}


4. Use a while loop to print the integers from 0 to 20 inclusive.
5. Use a while loop to print the even integers from 0 to 20 inclusive.
6. Use a while loop to print the powers of 2 from 1 to 10000 inclusive (including 1).
